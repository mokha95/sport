    1.1 Présentation personnelle

Hello, I'm Mohamed, and I live in Taverny. I used to work in sales, but a few years ago, I wanted to try something new.I got interested in the web, so I started watching videos about it. I really enjoyed it, and it made me want to learn more.

So, I decided to study. I applied for different training programs, and guess what? I got accepted by Greta! 
I'm excited about this opportunity to learn more about web development. Looking forward to the journey ahead!

My project is a gym website. Users can sign up and become members to enjoy benefits such as participating in events, reading content reserved for members, and having access to facilities for effective training.
